SCP-055 is a "self-keeping secret" or "anti-meme". Information about SCP-055's physical appearance as well as its nature, behavior, and origins is self-classifying.
%
We have SCP-666 and SCP-013. But there's no SCP-001. And there's no SCP-055.
%
There are contagious concepts which require containment just like any physical threat. They get inside your head, and ride your mind to reach other minds.
%
Antimemes are dangerous, and we don't understand them; therefore, they are part of the Problem. Hence my division. We can do the sideways thinking that's needed to combat something which can literally eat your combat training.
%
Do we have an Irony Division?
%
You spoke four languages. One now, and soon zero.
%
Ideas don't die.
%
If you know it exists, it knows you exist. The more you know about it, the more it knows about you. If you can see it, it can see you.
%
This is not the first Antimemetics Division. Before 1976, there was another one. I was part of that division; possibly, I led it. Certainly, I am the only known survivor of it. Something happened to that team. Some antimemetic force chewed up and swallowed the idea of the Antimemetics Division itself.
%
We got looped. It was textbook. We built the unthinkable bomb and test-detonated it… and it worked perfectly. The bomb destroyed itself, and erased its own successful detonation, and flattened all the knowledge which had gone together to build it. We forgot that we had ever built the bomb at all, and started over.
%
How do you fight an enemy without ever discovering it exists? How do you win without even realising you're at war?
%
We're the last ones in the world. After us, there's nobody.
%
I need an updated SCP entry, just to begin with. I need you to nail down the model for Grey's predatory pattern and exactly how you defeated it. I want you to work out what it did with the bodies—incinerated, disintegrated, or just left them lying around the site in rotting perceptually cloaked heaps. And I need countermeasures for when it comes back.
%
Ideas can be killed. With better ideas.
%
If something can cross over from conceptual space into reality, taking physical form, then something can cross in the opposite direction. It must be possible to take a physical entity, mechanically extract the idea which it embodies, amplify that idea and broadcast it up into conceptual space.
%
Whatever the monster is, it's colossally tall, or maybe it flies.
%
Humans have been looping through this problem over and over again since long before the Forties. Maybe for centuries!
%
It's a defense mechanism. This information-swallowing behaviour is just the outer layer, the poison coating. It protects the entity from discovery while it infests our reality.
%
We can only record what it isn't. We know it isn't Safe or Euclid. We know it isn't round, or square, or green or silver. We know it isn't stupid. And we know it isn't alone.
%
Why do you think the Antimemetics Division would show up in the listing?
%
An Antimemetics Division operative is as good on their first day as they're ever likely to be. You come to the job firing on all cylinders, or not at all. The rest is just fine-tuning and chemistry.
%
There is an invisible monster which follows me around and likes to eat my memories. SCP-4987. Don't look it up, it's not there. I've learned to manage with it. It's like a demanding pet. I produce tasty memories on purpose so it doesn't eat something important, like my passwords or how to make coffee.
%
When I first joined the Foundation, I asked my mentor, who retired many years ago, 'What's the biggest anomaly we've ever contained?' And he told me about a very old rumor he once heard. The rumor was that Abrahamic religions had not always been monotheistic. Originally, there were three capital-G Gods. And sometime in the past hundred and fifty years, the Foundation had killed two of them.
%
Secure the anomalies, contain the anomalies, protect the anomalies. How does it scan otherwise?
%
We could immediately terminate and suppress all memetics and antimemetics research worldwide. We would have to systematically dismantle the whole scientific field forever. Stop all the experiments, scrap all the research, brainwash all the researchers. If nobody actively researches this field, nobody will ever find SCP-3125. It stays buried in the farthest reaches of ideatic space indefinitely, like radioactive waste.
%
We live in a world bathed with SCP-3125. That's the loss condition.
%
This is what the human race really is. We lied to ourselves that we could be better, for thousands of years. But this is it. This is what we've always been. We've never been anything else.
%
We have learned that there is time missing from our world. Almost a year of extremely recent history. And there are spaces, significant spaces, in every population center, which cannot be perceived or entered. The cities are rerouting around them, like mountains or radiation zones.
%
But if we have learned nothing else, we have learned this: humans can walk away from, and forget, anything. Civilization can go back to "normal" after anything.
%
It's a big reality. It's a big Foundation. There's a lot of Keters and a lot of Keter-class scenarios. So, maybe the end of the world will be some other Division's problem.
%
Welcome to the Antimemetics Division. This is your first day.
%
Reminder: There is no Antimemetics Division. If you believe you are employed by the Antimemetics Division, you have missed a dose. Please report to the infirmary to have your timeline synchronized.
%
Today is your first day. Yesterday was also your first day. If you survive, tomorrow will be your first day. Welcome to the team.
%
You are currently carrying a loaded weapon. You do not remember arming yourself. You do not remember what you are hunting. But your muscle memory knows exactly what to do when you see it.
%
Do not visualize the entity. Do not conceptualize the entity. Do not think about the number five. Do not think about a hand with five fingers. Stop thinking.
%
Your password is the shape of a thought that kills anyone else who tries to think it.
%
The good news is that we have successfully contained the anomaly. The bad news is that the containment unit is your skull, and we have lost the key.
%
SCP-055 is not a sphere. It is not a cat. It is not Safe.
%
You have been fighting a silent war for ten years. You are the sole survivor. You have forgotten every battle. You are winning.
%
Side effects of Class-W mnestics may include: nausea, vertigo, pancreatic cancer, and the sudden realization that your spouse never existed.
%
If you are reading this, the timeline has already been compromised. Please consume the attached cyanide capsule and wait for a reality reset.
%
We built a machine to save the world. We forgot to build a button to turn it on. We forgot we built the machine. We forgot the world needed saving.
%
Warning: You are currently perceiving a Level V cognitohazard. If you can read this sentence, please dispose of your remains in the nearest incinerator to prevent contamination.
%
The keypad code is 5-5-5-5-5.
%
There is a hole in your memory shaped exactly like a person you loved.
%
Protecting humanity requires sacrifice. Specifically, it requires sacrificing the knowledge that you are protecting humanity.

The invisible spider in the corner of the room thinks you look delicious today ^w^
